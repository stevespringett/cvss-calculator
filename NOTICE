CVSS v4.0 Implementation
------------------------

The CVSS v4.0 scoring implementation in this project incorporates data and 
algorithm logic from the official CVSS v4.0 Calculator reference implementation:

  https://github.com/FIRSTdotorg/cvss-v4-calculator

Specifically:
  - MacroVector lookup table (cvss_lookup.js) - 233 score mappings
  - MaxSeverity depth table (max_severity.js) - interpolation parameters
  - MaxComposed data (max_composed.js) - highest severity vectors for each EQ
  - Scoring algorithm logic (cvss_score.js) - MacroVector derivation and interpolation
